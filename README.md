# Board Game Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a system that recommends board games based on user preferences. By analyzing various features of different board games, the system provides suggestions that match the interests of users.

## How to Set Up
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/board-game-recommendation.git
     cd board-game-recommendation
     ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Run this command to install the necessary libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## How to Use
To use the recommendation system:
1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the project.
2. Run the cells to see how the recommendation system works.
3. You can change the inputs to see different recommendations!

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project includes various information about board games, such as:
- **Game ID**: Unique identifier for each game.
- **Description**: Brief details about the game.
- **Max Players**: Maximum number of players that can play.
- **Min Age**: Recommended minimum age to play.
- **Average Rating**: The average score given by users.
- **Categories**: Types of games (e.g., strategy, family).
- **Mechanics**: Gameplay mechanics used in the games.

## Data Analysis
Before building the recommendation system, we analyze the data to understand:
- The distribution of ratings.
- Popular game categories and mechanics.
- Relationships between the number of players and ratings.

## Preprocessing Steps
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. Steps include:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filling in or removing missing data.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categories into numerical values.
- **Normalizing Data**: Adjusting values to a common scale.

## Machine Learning Models Used
We used machine learning algorithms to create the recommendation system. Key models include:
- **Nearest Neighbors**: This model finds games similar to the ones a user likes, based on their features.

## Results
The recommendation system generates suggestions based on user input. The performance is evaluated by how well the recommended games match user preferences.

      <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
      <p>Our group is motivated by a shared love of board games and the positive impact they have on family and social time. George enjoys playing games with his family during game nights and hopes to get his kids off electronics to spend more quality time together. Katie plays board games with her dad, who collects them, giving her experience with a wide variety of games. Chris has been playing games since childhood and enjoys them with both family and friends. Our goal is to create a recommendation system that strengthens these connections and helps others discover games they’ll love.</p>

      <h2>Research Guiding Question</h2>
      <p>Our guiding question revolves around creating an effective board game recommendation system that helps families discover games tailored to their unique preferences and requirements. We aim to explore various factors, including age ranges, categories, playtimes, and mechanics. By focusing on these aspects, we can ensure that our recommendations cater to different family dynamics and individual preferences. This approach not only enhances the gaming experience for families but also encourages meaningful connections and shared enjoyment during game nights. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a comprehensive system that simplifies the selection process and promotes quality family time through board gaming.</p>

      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>Our inspiration for this project comes from our love for board games and the special memories they create during family gatherings. George is motivated by his desire to spend quality time with his kids and get them off electronics, encouraging them to engage with each other through gaming. Katie has fond memories of playing games with her dad, who has a large collection of them, and she loves sharing those moments together. Chris, who grew up playing games, enjoys introducing his friends and family to the joy of board gaming. Together, we want to create a system that helps families find games that fit their unique dynamics, making it easier for them to enjoy fun and meaningful moments together.</p>

      <h2>Color Palette Reference</h2>
      <p>In the project, the light yellow background (#fff8db) creates a warm atmosphere. The rich golden yellow header and footer (#d19c40) add vibrancy, while the dark gold (#ba7a2a) is used for borders and hover effects.

        Text is styled with dark gray (#333) for body content, medium gray (#444) for headings, and light gray (#555) for paragraphs. The hover effect for profile cards is a yellowish tint (#ffdf80).
        
        Action buttons have a warm gold background (#e0a458) that turns to a darker gold on hover. The game board features a soft green for the start square (#b0e57c) and red for the finish square (#e57373). Overall, these colors create a playful, family-oriented board game theme.
